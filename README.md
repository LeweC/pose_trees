# pose_trees
This repository includes implementations that were development and evaluated for a Bachelors Thesis, which is included above(soon). The implementation where build upon an Octree/Quadtree/N-dimensional linear tree library from [attcs/Octree](https://github.com/attcs/Octree)
All inplementation are inlcuded as header files for a 3D Pose. This repo also includes the file that was used to create the data of the results.

## Short Overview see Thesis for more information
This repository includes implementations to test NNS times in N-dimensional axis-alligned trees for poses(position + orientation). This includes 5 approaches to with different aspects to compensate the continouty property of Euler Angles.

Best approaches...
Use quaternion or AlgoV2 depending on the usecase.
